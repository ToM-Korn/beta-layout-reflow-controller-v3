## Purpose ##
This is the first step of command line tools | controlling software for the Reflow
Controller by Beta Layout.
For me it was neccessary to keep the ofen at a certain temperature for a defined time.
For example to dry a photo positiv paint or a photo positiv solder mask
Further i dried cleaned electronic component for example at 60ยบ C for 30 minutes with
the script.
